h1. Rails-Template-Recipes

This project is a fork of "fnichol/rails-template-recipes":https://github.com/fnichol/rails-template-recipes.

What's here is a collection of Ruby scripts ("recipes") that are used to customize the application templates that are created by the RailsWizard web app. "Rails Wizard":http://railswizard.org/ is a website you can visit to create application templates that are used to generate a Rails 3 web application.

h4. Related Projects

Here's a tutorial that shows how an example application is built from a combination of recipes:

* "Tutorial for rails3-mongoid-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/wiki/Tutorial-%28Walkthrough%29

Here are finished application templates that are assembled from recipes:

* "rails3-application-templates":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates

You can see an example application that was created from the recipes:

* "rails3-mongoid-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/

h2. A Little More Explanation

Rails has a command that looks like this:

@$ rails new app_name -m /path/to/application-template.rb@

which generates a new Rails application and customizes it according to a script defined in the *application-template.rb* file.

You can create an *application-template.rb* file yourself or use one that someone else has written. Or you can visit "http://railswizard.org/":http://railswizard.org/, select various ingredients from a menu, and programmatically generate a new application template.

Rails Wizard might not have all the ingredients or customizations you want for your Rails app. This is a collection of extra recipes that you can add to the Rails Wizard mix.

h2. Usage Example

Add the following to the *Customize Template* section at "http://railswizard.org/":http://railswizard.org/:

<pre>
  git_repo = "https://github.com/fortuity/rails-template-recipes"
  @recipe_list = recipes ; def recipe_list; @recipe_list end
  def extra_recipes; @extra_recipes end
  @extra_recipes = %w{ git cleanup ban_spiders }
  @extra_recipes.each { |r| apply "#{git_repo}/raw/master/#{r}.rb" }
</pre>

Note that @extra_recipes@ is a list of filenames from this repository (without the *.rb* extension).

h2. Dependencies

Before generating a new Rails app using an application template, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.8.7 or 1.9.2)
* Rails (version 3.0.4 or newer)

bq. You MUST be using Rails 3.0.4 or newer. Generating a Rails application from an "HTTPS" URL does not work in Rails 3.0.3 and earlier versions.

I recommend installing rvm, the "Ruby Version Manager":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/, to manage multiple versions of Rails.

If you are using rvm, you can see a list of the Ruby versions currently installed:
@$ rvm list@

Check that appropriate versions of Ruby and Rails are installed in your development environment:
@$ ruby -v@
@$ rails -v@

h2. How It Works

Rails generators can use any methods provided by the "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions module. The flexibility of mixing "recipes" for application templates comes from use of the @apply@ method from the Thor::Actions module. Given a web address or a local filepath, the "apply method":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions#apply-instance_method loads and executes a file within the context of the generator script.

h2. Documentation and Support

This is the only documentation.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/generators/actions.rb.

Please send a message (via GitHub) or a "pull request" if you've written recipes you'd like to contribute.
